            Sections of spiny and succulent plants
        </h1>
          <p> Since the spiny and succulent plants are many in number and have different characteristics, they are a diverse and varied plant group in their forms, and they have many modifications to suit the environment in which they live; Scientists have divided this group of plants into several groups according to certain considerations as follows</p>
             <h2> According to the presence of thorns</h2>
          <h3> This group is divided into two main groups</h3>
     <ol>
        <li> Cactus spiny plants </li>    
        <li> Succulants succulent plants </li>
     </ol>
          <h2>  the most important fork families: </h2>
        <p> Cactaceae, Euphorbaceae and contains more than 290 genera and thousands of species, and the most important succulent families: Liliaceae, Agavaceae, Aizoaceae.</p>
          <h2> According to the nature of the water-storing organ: </h2>
            <h3> Spiny and succulent plants are also divided, regardless of the presence or absence of thorns, into the following groups:</h3>
     <ul> 
        <li> Leaf succulents: They store water absorbed in their leaves. They are characterized by no stems or short stems, and their leaves are pubescent and juicy, such as Aloe, Aloe, Mesenbryanthennu, tiger skin, Sansevieria, Kalanchoe, Sedu and many other types.</li>
        <li> Stem succulents: These plants store water in the market or transformed market and are characterized by reduced or absent leaves and may or may not contain spines such as: Opuntia, Euphorbia, Euphorbia, Cereus, Echinocactus, Astrophutum</li>
        <li> Root succulents: This group is also called the tuberous succulents and is known as Caudicifornus Plants. It is characterized by a large, strong root group, with a lack of the vegetative group, and the vegetative group may disappear for several months from the surface of the ground and then reappear when conditions are improved, such as the Focked Fockia plant.</li>   
     </ul>
          <h2>  According to the nature of flowering </h2>
          <h3> the division of spiny and succulent plants according to flowering into two groups</h3>
          <ul> 
            <li> Leafy succulents: their flowers are worthless, and their flowering ends in a very short period, such as: candelabra, agave, cactus, and prickly pear.
            </li> 
            <li> Flowering succulents: they are characterized by giving beautiful and abundant flowers, and flowering continues for a long period, such as: Alaptania, Lambrances, Hay Alam, Kalanchoe and Schlumbergera, which are used as flowering pot plants for internal coordination.</li>
          </ul>
          <h1> Environmental needs of succulents and thistles</h1>
          <h4>  For the success of the production of succulent plants, it is preferable to grow them in an atmosphere and environment similar to their natural environment in terms of soil, temperature, lighting, nutrients, and moisture.</h4>
          
            <p> The cultivation medium: The basic medium for cultivation should be sand, with silt added to it or a little bit of house moss. Calcium phosphate or lime may be added to the mixture.</p> 
            <h3> Water needs: The following must be taken into account when irrigating thistles and succulents </h3>
          <ol>
            <li> Regular watering leads to elongation and mold </li> 
            <li> Reducing irrigation during November until March, and increasing it in summer.</li>  
            <li> Irrigation can be increased during flowering, after fertilization, during the production period of the back.</li>   
            <li> Reducing the rate of irrigation with low light and indoors </li>
            </ol>
            <h5>  Thermal needs: It is preferable to raise the temperature during the different stages of cactus growth from germination - vegetative growth, flowering, so that the plants do not rot. The most appropriate temperature is from 20-25 or planting in a sunny place. And some types of agave.</h5>
            <h5>  Light needs: Most succulents and thistles need high light for a long time. But some of them are relatively shade-tolerant and do not mean living entirely in the shade, such as: Cactus, Sir Bergia, Gastria, Haworthia. Light needs also play an important role in the flowering of many cacti such as cedar, Kalanchoe, and Schlumbergeria that need a short day. As for the echeveria plant, it needs a short day followed by a long day, while Aloe plants need a long day followed by a short day to push flowering.</h5>             
            <h5>  Fertilizer needs: Most of the succulent and spiny plants need to raise the percentage of phosphorous, potassium and calcium elements, while decreasing the percentage of nitrogen. Potassium plays an important role in strengthening the thorns and flowering, and calcium in pushing flowering, while phosphorous plays an important role in fruiting. Therefore, it is preferable to use potassium phosphate fertilizers, calcium phosphate or calcium nitrate as a source of nitrogen. Charcoal, crushed bones or chalk may be added to the growing media for good growth of these plants.</h5>

            <h2> popular Succulent Types </h2>
            <h3> Echeveria Elegans </h3>

            <h3> Haworthia Zebra Plant </h3>
            <p> Haworthia Fasciata and Haworthia Atennuata are very popular types of South African succulent plants. Dark green, thick and long leaves are covered all over with the horizontal white stripes, make the plant look like a zebra. Zebra plants propagate themselves by giving offsets, so they spread over very quickly.</p>
